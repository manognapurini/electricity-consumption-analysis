# Electricity Consumption Analysis

## Objective
To analyze electricity consumption data and identify usage patterns, peak demand hours, and overall consumption trends using Python.

## Dataset
The dataset contains time-stamped electricity consumption values with the following fields:
- Date: Date and time of measurement
- Global_active_power: Electricity usage value

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Analysis Performed
- Loaded and cleaned electricity consumption data
- Converted date-time values for time-based analysis
- Analyzed hourly electricity consumption patterns
- Visualized average power usage using line charts

## Key Insights
- Electricity consumption varies significantly across different hours of the day
- Peak usage occurs during specific daytime and evening hours
- Off-peak hours show lower electricity demand

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical data analysis and visualization skills applied to real-world electricity consumption data.
